    # The Contact Object

    ### Description

    A `Contact` is an individual or business entity to which products and services are sold to or purchased from. The `Contact` model contains both Customers, in which products and services are sold to, and Vendors (or Suppliers), in which products and services are purchased from.

    - A `Contact` is a Vendor/Supplier if the `is_supplier` property is true.
    - A `Contact` is a customer if the `is_customer` property is true.

    ### Usage Example

    Fetch from the `LIST Contacts` endpoint and view a company's contacts.
